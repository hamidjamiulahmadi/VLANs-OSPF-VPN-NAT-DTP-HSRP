<h2>Goal</h2>
<br />In this lab, I will configure the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) to facilitate connectivity between the Frankfurt customer branch and the Berlin sales branch. Additionally, I will incorporate two Internet Service Providers (ISPs) into the network architecture, ensuring that in the event of a connection loss with ISP1, traffic will seamlessly reroute through ISP2 for redundancy. To achieve this objective, I will utilize a total of five Cisco routers, two switches, two personal computers, and two laptops. The initial phase will involve configuring each router with its designated interfaces, followed by the assignment of IP addresses to the PCs and laptops. Subsequently, I will implement the EIGRP protocol on each router, explicitly defining the networks associated with each interface. Finally, I will conduct rigorous testing to confirm the optimal functionality of the entire configuration..
