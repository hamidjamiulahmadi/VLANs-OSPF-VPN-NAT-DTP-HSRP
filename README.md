<h1>VLANs,OSPF,VPN,NAT,DTP,HSRP</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<br />In the network that I am setting up, I will configure the Zurich network users to have access to the HQ servers, ensuring that users from the Zurich side can seamlessly connect to the Abu Dhabi servers.
Additionally, to ensure optimal connectivity, I will configure VLANs (Virtual Local Area Network), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), VPN (Virtual Private Network), NAT (Network Address Translation), DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol), and HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) in this lab environment.

<br />


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Packet Tracer</b> 
- <b>Windows 11</b>

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>
Step Nr.1: The initial step involves creating a network diagram to provide a clearer understanding of the process and illustrate the methodology to be employed.
